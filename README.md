Summary:
Indecision. We all know the feeling, and it can strike at any time. You’re hoping to impress your date with your dining discernment. You’re stoked to scope out the culinary scene in a new city. You want to explore eateries in your neighborhood.

Choosing a restaurant can be tough, especially when you’re spammed with so many choices. Popular restaurant rating sites are great, but they easily overwhelm. You could find yourself with 12 tabs open, comparing pad thais before realizing half the places you’re pondering are closed. Then you might end up slogging through traffic on a cross-town commute to a mediocre meal.
